I am Meghana, currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science at Mahindra University. I am a dedicated and focused individual with a keen interest in data sciences and frontend development. My technical expertise includes programming in C, Python, and Java, along with proficiency in ReactJS. I excel in adaptability, teamwork, and maintaining composure under pressure. As a reflection of my academic dedication, I was awarded scholarships in both my first and second years. Beyond academics, photography has nurtured my creative thinking and attention to detail. My project experience includes building a machine learning model for disease prediction, conducting data analysis for earthquake prediction using Tableau, and working on an ongoing project to detect the bioactivity of proteins. My fascination with how applications work and how technology shapes the world inspired me to pursue Computer Science.
